# Hi, I am Martin!
I'm a versatile professional with a unique journey that bridges the worlds of structural engineering and software development. My educational background includes Master's degrees in architecture and structural engineering from the University of Illinois. During my time as a structural engineer, I harnessed my skills in Python and Grasshopper to automate processes, optimize designs, and visualize data.

Recognizing the exciting possibilities in the world of software engineering, I embarked on a career pivot. In 2022, I had the privilege of attending the Recurse Center, a transformative experience that deepened my passion for coding and problem-solving. Subsequently, I did contract work focusing on building applications that complemented my previous expertise in structural engineering.

Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I continue to expand my knowledge and skills in the software development field.

My unique blend of experiences in both structural engineering and software development equips me with a diverse skill set to tackle complex challenges in today's ever-evolving tech landscape. I'm always excited to explore new opportunities and collaborate on innovative projects.

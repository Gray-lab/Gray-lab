# Hi, I am Martin!
I am a graduate of University of Illinois with Master degrees in architecture and structural engineering. After spending several years working as a structural engineer, and learning Grasshooper and Python to automate optimization, geometry generation and data visualization, I decided to pivot my career towards software engineering. I did a batch at the Recurse Center in 2022, started my own software contracting company to develop applications adjacent to my previous career, and am currently working on a Master's CS degree at Georgia Institute of Technology.
